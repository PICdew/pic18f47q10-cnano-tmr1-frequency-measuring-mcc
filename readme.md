# PIC18F47Q10 Using TMR1 Gate to measure frequency

## Objective:
This example shows how to use the TMR1 configured in gate single pulse and toggle combined mode. It with sample a full period of a signal. A GPIO pin will be configured as input and it will be connected to a periodical signal.

## Demo:
Run the code in debug mode. Pin RB5 is configured as digital input. A periodical signal needs to be applied to this pin. Set a breakpoint inside "TMR1_GATE_ISR()". The measured frequency will be stored in
the variable called "value". The code will stop at the breakpoint when the signal period has ended.
